# Brainfuck Interpreter

Written in C

> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
>
> Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer.

## Building:

``git clone https://gitlab.com/yuri-the-cockroach/brainfuck-interpreter.git && cd brainfuck-interpreter && make build``

## Usage:

### Running:
``$./bf-run {--file {path/to/file}} [--debug] [--char]``

meaning:
* --file  -- path to the file containing brainfuck code. For example hellow_world.bf
* --debug -- enable debug output
* --char  -- interpret the output as characters instead of integers

### Syntax:
| Character | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                           |
